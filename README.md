## Jets Project

###Big Help
#### Build the meat of the project in the main and the airfield.
####The objects/children only are the bones.

###Array
####Build it big to add more planes later
####Declare, Initialize, make Array
####Name the list out, copy paste list
###Airfield will hold array and most methods calls

###Interface
####Will hold sentence of what aircraft does
####Dont forget to link up the object with the interface

###Do switch not if statement for the list
####This is specific numbers like a remote
####Most likely to go on main/ its where user inputs things
